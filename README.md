# Xiamen-Airline-Demand-Forecasting-Capacity-Control
This is a pricing and revenue management project based on the historical sales data provided by Xiamen Airlines. We mainly use the moving average method, EM algorithm and quadratic exponential smoothing method to forecast the demand respectively, and get the demand parameters that obey the normal distribution. Then we use Matlab to carry out simulation experiments and generate the corresponding demand data.Finally, different income control models are established and the optimal income policy is obtained after comparison.
